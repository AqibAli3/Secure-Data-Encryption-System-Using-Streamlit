# üîê Secure Data Encryption System

### **Description**
The **Secure Data Encryption System** is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit. It allows users to securely store and retrieve sensitive data. User credentials and encrypted data are persistently stored in JSON files. The app uses Fernet encryption for securing data, PBKDF2 for hashing passkeys, and includes multi-user authentication with sign-up and login functionality.

---

## **Features**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Data Encryption:** Encrypt and store your sensitive data using Fernet symmetric encryption.
- üóùÔ∏è **Passkey-based Decryption:** Retrieve your data by providing a passkey.
- üîí **User Authentication:** Multi-user login and sign-up functionality for account management.
- üîè **Hashed Passwords:** User passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 for enhanced security.
- üö´ **Brute Force Protection:** Three failed login or decryption attempts trigger a timed lockout.
- üìÅ **Persistent Storage:** User credentials and encrypted data are saved in JSON files (`users.json` and `data.json`).
- üì• **Decryption Results Download:** Download decrypted data as a text file.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** Streamlit for building an interactive web interface.
- **Backend:** Python for encryption, decryption, and authentication logic.
- **Encryption Library:** Cryptography module (Fernet encryption).
- **Data Storage:** Persistent JSON files (`users.json`, `data.json`).

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone or Download the Project:**
   Download or clone this repository into your local system.

2. **Install Python:**
   Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed on your machine. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   In your project directory, create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
   - **Activate (Windows):**
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Activate (macOS/Linux):**
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Required Packages:**
   With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit cryptography
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   Start the Streamlit application by running:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The application will open in your default browser. If it doesn‚Äôt, check the terminal for the local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) and open it manually.

## **Usage**
1. **Sign Up:**  
   Create an account on the **Sign Up** page by providing a unique username and password.

2. **Login:**  
   Use the **Login** page to log into your account with your credentials.

3. **Store Data:**  
   - Navigate to the **Store Data** page.
   - Enter a label, your data, and a passkey.
   - Save the encrypted data securely.

4. **Retrieve Data:**  
   - Navigate to the **Retrieve Data** page.
   - Select the encrypted data entry and provide the associated passkey.
   - View and optionally download the decrypted data.

## **File Structure**
Here‚Äôs an overview of the files used in this application:

- **`app.py`:** The main application file.
- **`users.json`:** Persistent storage for user credentials.
- **`data.json`:** Persistent storage for encrypted data.
- **`secret.key`:** The encryption key for Fernet, generated and used internally.

---

## **Security Notes**
- For demonstration purposes, this app uses a **static salt** for PBKDF2 hashing and a shared encryption key for Fernet. In a production environment:
  - Use a **unique salt** for each user.
  - Store the Fernet key securely (e.g., environment variables or a secrets manager).
  - Consider integrating a proper database for enhanced data storage and security.

---

## **Known Limitations**
- Lockout duration is fixed at 30 seconds (configurable in the code).  
- JSON-based storage is used instead of a database, which may not scale well with many users or large datasets.
